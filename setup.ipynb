This step is necessary because in lines 52-53 we skip the reviews containing only images or videos (i.e. review text = \"The media could not be loaded.\"). This means that at each page, we might end up having more review dates than actual review texts. The `date_result.pop(-1)` (line 74) basically removes the last item of the date_result list until the length of `rev_result` and `date_result` are the same.
