This means that at each page, we might end up having more review dates than actual review texts. The `date_result.pop(-1)` (line 74) basically removes the last item of the date_result list until the length of `rev_result` and `date_result` are the same.

    "After the introductory parts (importing libraries and setting up title and description of the dashboard - line 1-22), we **create a connection to the Trino DB** where our data is stored (lines 25-36). Pay attention that since we will run this script outside of VDK, we cannot use it's `execute_query` method and we need to set up a manual connection using the trino Python package. To get the necessary configurations for the connection, we use environment variables (the statements that look like `os.environ.get(variable_name)`) that were initialized in the \"start\" system file (located in the main directory) that MyBinder uses to set up the environment in which we are currently executing our scripts. If we are running those scripts locally on our computers (outside of MyBinder), then the contents of the \"start\" system file should be executed from a terminal before running a data job.\n",
    "\n",
    "In lines 38-40 we read data from the weekly correlation table using pandas `read_sql_query` method that directly converts the output into a pandas data frame. We transform the date into datetime format (line 42) and then **make a line plot using matplotlib Python package**. The plot will show the number of weekly COVID-19 cases versus \"no scent\" complaints over time. \n",
    "\n",
    "After that we build another line plot that will show **how the correlation coefficients change over time**. In line 66 we first show the current correlation coefficient as a KPI and below we show the line plot (lines 68-71). This time it's plotted using streamlit's built-in method `st.line_chart()`. The last thing we display in the dashboard is a table with the weeks and the respective correaltion coefficients (lines 72-78)."
